// End-to-end testing for terminal apps: launch any command in a PTY attached
// to a real terminal emulator engine — Ghostty's VT core (WebAssembly) or
// xterm.js — and drive it with Playwright-style locators, key presses, and
// Vitest matchers. The engines and the PTY are loaded on demand.
//
// Published as `@alchemy.run/sigil/testing`; emulator engines remain lazy.
